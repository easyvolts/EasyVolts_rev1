# EasyVolts_rev1
repository for EasyVolts_rev1 device. EasyVolts is a tiny variable power supply with embedded "USB-to-serial" adapter for both UART and RS-485 interfaces which is controlled and powered entirely by USB (over Virtual COM port). It's not only a simple and convenient tool, but it also can be used as a universal bridge between PC software and the "real" world (for example it can be very handy in smart home systems where RS485 and 12v power supply are widely used). This project failed campaign on the IndieGoGo (https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/easyvolts-usb-powered-and-controlled-power-supply#/) so now its sources are made open to share my expirience and ideas among hobbyists.

Hopefully, in future I'll try to launch next generation of the project, with output voltage up to 24v, configurable GPIO/PWM outputs and USB3.0 support (it would be good to have more power). For more details check my web site www.easyvolts.com
