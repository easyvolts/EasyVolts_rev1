The device accepts 2 commands:
1) uXXXX\r\n - set voltage, where XXX is desired voltage in mV. For example u3300\r\n will set output to 3v3. Max value is 15000.
2) iXXXX\r\n - set current limit, where XXX is desired current limit in mA. For example i100 sets current limit to 100mA. Max value is 1000.

The device periodically sends to PC strings with measured output voltage, current and state. The strings look like:
"EasyVolts 	U(mV)=3300    	^I(mA)=100\r\n" - Uout=3v3, Iout=100mA, "^" - means that overcurrent protection is active.
"EasyVolts 	U(mV)=3300    	 I(mA)=100\r\n" - Uout=3v3, Iout=100mA, " " - means that output is active, no overload.
"EasyVolts 	U(mV)=3300    	_I(mA)=0\r\n"   - Uout=3v3, Iout=0mA,   "_" - means that output is OFF, current = 0, but voltage on output is 3v3(for exaple if there is an external source connected).
